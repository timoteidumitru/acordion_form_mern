## React Accordion Form - MERN stack

### Project guide

```
#### Server Install modules
npm install

#### Client install modules
cd client && npm install

#### once modules have been installed you can run:
npm start -> to start client

### then open new terminal and to get back to root folder where server lies then run the following command:
tsc -> to creat the build followed by command:
npm start -> to start the server

### Once you're here you can test the app: having some validation on the server side and some basic validation on the client

### I could work abit more on validation for frontend using libraries such as formik and yup and some work on functionalities could be done aswell for the "pixel perfect side"


### Hope you enjoy of this little MERN app I've made.
